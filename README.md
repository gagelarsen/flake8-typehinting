# Type Hinting Flake8 Plugin
    
This is a simple plugin for checking type hinting. It does not 
check all parts of the `pep484` standard. Feature request and
pull requests will be accepted for adding more checks. 

The Type Hinting Flake8 plugin has the following checks:

- `TH100`: function missing type hints for arguments
- `TH101`: function missing type hints for return value
